::: {.about-text}

Hi, I'm Shusuke Ioku, a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Rochester. I study historical political economy, combining formal theory with micro-level historical data to understand statebuilding and political extremism—particularly how the *periphery* of the state shaped state development and political radicalization.

My current research explores how peripheral regions politically excluded—rather than those merely experiencing economic distress—became hotspots of [fascist mobilization](research.qmd#fascist-paper) in interwar Japan. I also study how jurisdictional competition among feudal rulers in Tokugawa Japan enabled peripheral peasants to pursue [mass exit](research.qmd#exit-paper) instead of violent confrontation, effectively constraining extractive authority from below. A third line of work examines how statebuilders in early medieval Japan deliberately hollowed out their own administrative apparatus by privatizing extraction, initiating [feudal fragmentation](research.qmd#feudalism-paper) most prominently in peripheral regions where central authority was weak but local administrative capacity remained strong.

::: {.about-text}

Hi, I'm Shusuke Ioku, a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Rochester. I specialize in historical political economy, studying popular resistance and political extremism in Japanese history by integrating formal theory with detailed micro-level historical data.

My research explores how societies respond to state authority—examining the ways in which populations constrain, negotiate with, or fall under the control of ruling powers. I investigate how [mass exit](research.qmd#exit-paper) served as an alternative to direct resistance, disciplining feudal authorities in early modern Japan, as well as how ideological narratives helped ignite [fascist mobilization](research.qmd#fascist-paper) in interwar Japan.

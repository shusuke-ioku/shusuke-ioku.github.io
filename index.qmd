::: {.about-text}

Hi, I'm Shusuke Ioku, a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Rochester, specializing in historical political economy. I employ formal theory and micro-level historical data to study statebuilding and political extremism, focusing on how state subjects resist, negotiate with, or fall under the control of ruling powers.

My current research explores how [mass exit](research.qmd#exit-paper) served as a constraint on feudal authority in early modern Japan, as well as how political and economic upheavals, coupled with ideological narratives, fueled [fascist mobilization](research.qmd#fascist-paper) during the interwar period.

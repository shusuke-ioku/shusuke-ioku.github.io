    title: "Constrain with Their Feet: Jurisdictional Conflict and State Erosion in Early Modern Japan"
    status: Under review

      Throughout history, jurisdictional conflict among rival rulers has constrained oppression by enabling subjects to pursue mass exit—often to draw external intervention—instead of directly confronting authority. I document this mechanism in Tokugawa Japan, where a feudal structure of domains with similar institutions but divergent extractive capacity competed for subjects' loyalty, creating an ideal setting to observe a competitive market for governance. Leveraging newly digitized village-level records of peasant resistance, I show that villages geographically more exposed to neighboring external authority opted for exit over confrontation. I further show that domains facing more intense jurisdictional conflict (i.e., those governing villages more exposed to external authority) extracted lower taxes, net of alternative mechanisms. This relationship, as theoretically predicted, depends on neighboring domains' labor absorption capacity. These findings highlight mass exit as an _active_ form of popular constraint, surfacing a mechanism long overshadowed by scholarship's emphasis on direct resistance and notions of passive exit.

    title: "Fascism from Above: Elite Instigation and Agrarian Radicalization in Interwar Japan"
    status: Working paper
    abstract: >-
      When do economic crises trigger political radicalization? While previous research has concentrated on demand-side factors—such as economic deprivation and community density—this study highlights supply-side mechanisms, focusing on elite-driven instigation and ideological framing. To identify the causal effect of elite instigation, I leverage the May 1932 military coup in Japan as a natural experiment, employing novel monthly, prefecture-level data on right-wing organizations to isolate responses to distinct political shocks with temporal precision. The analysis reveals a sharp and immediate surge in mobilization, but only within the elite-primed Northeastern region. Competing society-side explanations—including deprivation, union density, rice dependency, and a range of placebo tests—do not account for these patterns. The findings underscore the centrality of the understudied supply-side mechanism as the crucial catalyst for radicalization.

  - title: "Self-State Subversion: The Birth of Feudalism in Early Medieval Japan"
    status: Working paper
    abstract: >-
      While scholars broadly agree that feudal orders arose from the limitations
      of centralized state control, much less is known about the mechanisms
      through which this process began and unfolded---specifically, who fostered
      the fragmentation of state power and where it originated. I propose a
      theoretical framework identifying the conditions under which statebuilders
      deliberately hollow out their own administrative apparatus by privatizing
      extraction: granting fiscal immunities in exchange for a share of the
      returns. I evaluate the model's implications using the case of early
      medieval Japan, where varying degrees of feudalization across regions can
      be systematically observed through estate commendations to the imperial
      court. Consistent with the theory, I find that estate commendation by
      emerging local warrior elites occurred most prominently in peripheral
      regions where central authority was weak but local administrative capacity
      remained strong.

  - title: "Hydraulic Civilizations"
    status: Work in progress
    abstract: >-
      Although agricultural surplus was vital for early state formation, it also
      exposed states to external threats. I claim that while surplus itself
      jeopardized states, the administrative capacity to generate it---specifically
      hydraulic management---promoted state persistence. Maintaining costly
      irrigation systems provided rulers with bargaining leverage over both
      external predators and internal subjects, deterred both invasions and
      defections, and thereby fostered stable territorial control. I illustrate
      this argument through a formal model and test it using global data of
      historical polities since 3400 BCE. Duration analysis shows that states
      with greater hydraulic dependence, measured by the potential yield gap
      between irrigated and rainfed farming, tended to endure longer without
      losing territories, while higher absolute yields accelerated territorial
      loss. The result was exclusively found in earlier periods, where developing
      hydraulic systems was more costly. Additionally, polities with greater
      hydraulic dependence tended to develop more complex social structures.

  - title: "Military Innovation and Territorial State Formation"
    status: Work in progress
    coauthors: "Scott Abramson, Sergio Montero, and Michael Gibilisco"
    abstract: >-
      Social scientists have argued that conflict and military technological
      innovation fostered the formation of territorial states. While the
      literature has predominantly examined European history, Japan's
      Warring-States Period offers a unique context to test this claim; the
      island country initially composed by more than 100 autonomous local
      powerholders (daimyo) was exposed to an exogenous shock of military
      innovation, an accidental importation of firearms in 1543, after which
      the fragmented society rapidly transformed into a centralized state under
      a singular authority. Using original grid-year datasets of battles,
      castles, and territorial changes, we show (preliminary, descriptive)
      results suggesting that the technological shock diminished defensive
      advantage and made economic power better translate into battleground
      success, thereby inducing small rulers to concede their autonomy.
